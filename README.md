# Used Car Price Predictor

An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts the resale price of used cars based on features like brand, fuel type, transmission, and kilometers driven. It uses regression techniques to build a reliable and consistent model. The solution helps individuals and dealerships make informed pricing decisions.

---

## Objective

This project uses machine learning to predict used car prices by analyzing historical data. It examines how features like manufacturing year, fuel type, body type, and ownership history impact pricing. The regression model is built through data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation — for more accurate and fair pricing.

---

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains detailed records of used cars, with features that influence resale value. It includes 8 input variables and 1 target variable (`Price`), and each row represents a unique car listing.

**Features:**
- `Car Name` – The name or model of the car.
- `Year Bought` – The year when the car was purchased.
- `Distance` – The distance already travelled by the car (in kilometres).
- `Previous Owners` – The number of previous owners of the car.
- `Fuel` – Type of fuel used (Petrol, Diesel, or CNG).
- `Location` - The location of the Regional Transport Office (RTO).
- `Car Type` – The type of car (sedan, SUV, hatchback, luxury SUV, luxury sedan).
- `Transmission` - The type of transmission (automatic or manual).

**Target:**
- `Price` – The price of the car. (in lakhs ₹)

This structured dataset is ideal for a supervised regression problem and requires minimal cleaning, making it suitable for end-to-end modeling.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

To uncover meaningful patterns and relationships within the data, here are some of the key visualizations used:

### Distribution of Price
> A histogram showed that most of the cars are priced below ₹10 lakh, with a noticeable right skew. This helped identify the presence of outliers and informed the need for potential scaling or transformation.

### Year vs Price
> A boxplot revealed that newer cars tend to retain higher resale value, while older vehicles depreciate significantly. This confirmed the strong influence of manufacturing year on price.

### Kms Driven vs Price
> The scatter plot highlighted a negative correlation between kilometers driven and price. Cars with higher mileage generally sell for less, with a few outliers at both extremes.

### Top 10 Brands and Models
> A subplot featuring bar charts displayed the top 10 most listed car brands and models in the dataset. This provided a clear overview of the most represented brands and models in the used car listings, helping reveal supply trends and potential biases in price predictions.

### Owner Type vs Price
> A boxplot showed a clear drop in resale value as the number of previous owners increased. Cars with a single owner typically retained higher prices, highlighting how ownership history affects buyer perception and trust in vehicle condition.

## Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

The dataset was cleaned and prepared for modeling. The `Car_Name` column was split into `Brand` and `Model`, and several new features were created from existing columns. Categorical variables were one-hot encoded, and the final data was ready for training.

---

## Model Training & Evaluation

Multiple regression models were trained to predict used car prices. Their performance was evaluated using metrics like **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** and **R² Score** to identify the best-performing model.

### Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor

### Evaluation Metrics

- **RMSE:** Measures the average error in predictions. Lower is better.  
- **R² Score:** Shows how well the model explains the data. Higher is better.

### Performance Overview
The plot below compares the performance of each model based on RMSE and R² Score:
