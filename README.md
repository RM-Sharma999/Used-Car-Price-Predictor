# Used Car Price Predictor

An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts the resale price of used cars based on features like brand, fuel type, transmission, and kilometers driven. The model is trained to deliver reliable and consistent price estimates using regression techniques, helping individuals and dealerships make informed pricing decisions.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to apply machine learning to predict the resale price of a used cars based on historical data. It aims to uncover how different factors — such as year of manufacture, fuel type, body type, and ownership history — impact pricing, and to use this understanding to build an accurate regression model. This project covers all key stages of development — from data cleaning and feature engineering to model training and evaluation — demonstrating how machine learning can bring greater transparency and consistency to pricing decisions in the used car market.
